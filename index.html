                Hi I'm Tim! I enjoy making music and I am also a full time student at the University of Denver. My favorite genre of music would have to be hip-hop and RnB. I enjoy producing music and also singing on the songs that I produce. I am currently enrolled in the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp because I wish to understand the realm of coding.

                I am trying to make the best of life and be someone who excels in multiple areas of life. Although I am attending school for a psychology degree I want to be able to understand all aspects of life to develop a better understanding of life.
